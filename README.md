## 🧠 What I Learned

CS50x helped me build a strong foundation in computer science through real-world problem-solving. Some of the core concepts I explored include:

### 🔢 Algorithms
- Searching: Linear, Binary Search
- Sorting: Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge Sort
- Recursion and optimization

### 🗃️ Data Structures
- Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists
- Hash Tables, Tries, Stacks, Queues
- Trees (Binary Search Trees)

### 💾 Memory Management in C
- Pointers
- Dynamic memory allocation (`malloc`, `free`)
- Buffer overflows and segmentation faults

### 🌐 Web Programming
- Front-end basics: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Back-end: Python with Flask
- HTTP, RESTful APIs
- Sessions, authentication, templates

### 🛡️ Security & Software Design
- Cryptography basics (Caesar, Vigenère)
- Hashing (SHA-256)
- SQL injection and safe queries
- Clean code practices
