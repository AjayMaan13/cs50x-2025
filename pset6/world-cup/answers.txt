Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
None, its always random

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

I think after 100000 its taking up too much time
